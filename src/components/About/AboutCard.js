            Hello! I'm <span className="purple">Atharva Kulkarni</span>, a <b>Software Engineer</b> with a deep enthusiasm for full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and scalable web technologies.
            <br /><br />
            I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from Syracuse University and am currently working as a Research Intern with the universityâ€™s College of Engineering and Computer Science. As part of this role, Iâ€™m leading the development of an AI-powered job-matching platform aimed at helping students connect with on-campus opportunities.
            <br /><br />
            Professionally, Iâ€™ve also worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Clutch Delivery, where I developed customer-facing tools and delivery management features using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS. Iâ€™ve integrated secure payments with Stripe and improved internal efficiency with streamlined admin dashboards. Prior to that, I contributed as a full-stack web developer in India, optimizing REST APIs and enhancing backend performance in production systems built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
            <br /><br />
            My technical toolkit includes React, Node.js, Spring Boot, Java, SQL/MongoDB, and AWS. I enjoy building software thatâ€™s not only functional and secure, but also intuitive and scalable. Whether Iâ€™m designing backend services or crafting modern UIs, I bring both technical depth and a product-driven mindset to the work.
            <br /><br />

            And yes - I occasionally talk to my code! Itâ€™s cheaper than a rubber duck. ðŸ˜‰
